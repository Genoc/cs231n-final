"""
Example PyTorch script for finetuning a ResNet model on your own data.

For this example we will use a tiny dataset of images from the COCO dataset.
We have chosen eight types of animals (bear, bird, cat, dog, giraffe, horse,
sheep, and zebra); for each of these categories we have selected 100 training
images and 25 validation images from the COCO dataset. You can download and
unpack the data (176 MB) by running:

wget cs231n.stanford.edu/coco-animals.zip
unzip coco-animals.zip
rm coco-animals.zip

The training data is stored on disk; each category has its own folder on disk
and the images for that category are stored as .jpg files in the category folder.
In other words, the directory structure looks something like this:

coco-animals/
  train/
    bear/
      COCO_train2014_000000005785.jpg
      COCO_train2014_000000015870.jpg
      [...]

    cat/
